### Grading Information for Sherriff
We set up a special login for Professor Sherriff. When he goes to the link above, there will be a button that says "Sherriff login" that he should click to login through Github. Once he logs in, because it's his first time it will have him make an account. He should select what classes he is in (CS 3240), add a profile pic, and a bio (he will have the option to become a tutor if he wishes). After creating his profile, he can go to the home page. There he will see students he can "match" with to be Study Buddies. If he wishes to match press the green thumbs up, otherwise red thumbs down. When there are mutual matches they will appear in the "Matches" page with a clickable email address to contact them. He can search for students by first or last name/classes being taken. He can go to the Tutors page if he is looking for a tutor for a particular subject. Have fun playing with the site!
